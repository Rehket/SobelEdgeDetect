Adam Albright, UCF Robot Vsion
My Sobel Edge Detection project for Robot Vision. Sobel Code modified from the code available on http://www.cs.ucf.edu/courses/cap4453/

The program can be compiled using VS2015 c++ compiler and requires 4 command arguments to run the compiled program. The first is the input file name followed by the output file name which is inturn followed by the thresholds. The thresholds should be between 0 and 255.
